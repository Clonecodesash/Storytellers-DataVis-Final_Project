        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Understanding the geographic distribution of tertiary education is essential to
          identify patterns and disparities across European countries. This section explores how education levels vary
          regionally and how different nations have progressed in higher education attainment.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">The choropleth map illustrates the percentage of the population with tertiary
          education across Europe between the ages of 20-25, with darker shades representing higher percentages and
          lighter shades indicating lower levels. The map reveals significant regional disparities. Countries like
          Ireland , the United Kingdom, Croatia, and Serbia record percentages over 90% of the population. In contrast,
          nations such as Iceland, Turkey and Germany have lower levels, with less than 80% of their populations
          attaining higher education. Notably, countries in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Poland, Greece and the
          Czech Republic, have shown steady growth in tertiary education levels across the years reflecting recent
          educational reforms. </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-secondary mb-4">The Relationship Between Education and Income</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Higher education is often linked to increased earnings and economic stability. This section examines how
          different levels of education impact income across various European countries, highlighting trends and
          disparities.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 font-semibold flex justify-center my-8">Average Income by Educational Level</p>
        <app-bar></app-bar>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">The bar chart illustrates the relationship between educational attainment and
          income levels. It shows that as the education level increases, so does the average income. Individuals with a
          high school diploma earn the least, while those with a bachelor's degree see a noticeable jump in earnings.
          The highest incomes are observed among individuals with master's and doctorate degrees. This trend highlights
          the financial advantage of pursuing higher education. However, the chart also reveals any income gaps between
          different levels, emphasising the impact of education on earning potential. And in countries like Switzerland,
          Luxembourg, and Denmark, you notice the differences between the income of the level 0-2, 3-4 don't differ a
          lot from that of the level 5-8. In such a country, you realise education impacts your income.

        <p class="text-gray-900 font-semibold flex justify-center my-8">Income Inequality by Education Level</p>
        <app-stackedbar></app-stackedbar>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          This stacked bar chart illustrates the income distribution across different educational levels for a selection
          of European countries. On the Y-axis, countries are listed, while the X-axis represents income levels. Each
          bar is segmented by educational attainment levels, showing how much each educational group contributes to the
          total income distribution within a given country.
          The chart highlights how income inequality varies across education levels. For example, countries like
          Switzerland, Austria and Norway may show a smaller gap between educational levels, with high income levels
          across both secondary and tertiary education. On the other hand, countries like Luxembourg or Greece might
          show wider income disparities, with lower income for individuals with only primary or secondary education
          compared to those with tertiary education.
          By visualizing these income differences, the chart helps demonstrate the role education plays in shaping
          income inequality in different regions, allowing for easy comparisons between countries and the years.

        </p>
        <app-network></app-network>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-14 mb-6">The alluvial chart maps the interaction between educational attainment,
          income,
          and employment across European countries. Generally, you notice that over the years, the level 3-4 education
          increases concerning the population and usually people with educational levels of 5-8 earn above the 30,000s.
          The data shows that in Ireland, Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway, individuals with tertiary education
          overwhelmingly secure high-income and stable employment with a high percentage. In contrast, in Serbia and
          North Macedonia, even those with university degrees face lower-income jobs, reflecting weaker labour market
          integration. In Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary, tertiary education leads to better job prospects but
          does not always guarantee high wages. Meanwhile, in Norway and Switzerland, education does not strongly
          correlate with income, with little wage progression from secondary to tertiary levels.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-secondary mb-4"> Education and Economic Performance</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Educational attainment is often correlated with a nation's economic prosperity. This section explores the
          connection between education levels and GDP per capita to assess how education impacts economic performance.

        <app-bubble></app-bubble>
        <p class="text-gray-700 my-6">This bubble chart visualizes the complex relationship between educational
          attainment, employment rates, and income by country. The size of each bubble represents GDP, offering a
          comprehensive view of how education impacts employment and income levels across different European nations.
          Switzerland and Norway have more than 85% of the population with tertiary education employed with higher
          incomes. Another thing to notice is although Germany has a bigger economy, the income from Switzerland,
          Luxembourg and Norway is much higher than that of Germany and this is usually due to the different standards
          of living across countries. An individual with an immediate level of education from Germany still earns about
          the same salary as an individual with an advanced level of education.

        </p>
        <app-scatter></app-scatter>
        <p class="text-gray-700 my-6">
          This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the percentage of the population with tertiary education
          (higher education) and GDP per capita in Purchasing Power Standards (PPS) across European countries. PPS is a
          standardized measure that adjusts GDP to account for differences in living costs, with a value of 100
          representing the EU average. Countries with higher percentages of tertiary-educated individuals generally
          appear above the 100 PPS baseline, indicating a correlation between higher education levels and stronger
          economic performance. For example, nations like Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland and Ireland, with high
          tertiary education rates, tend to have GDP per capita significantly above the EU average, while countries with
          lower educational attainment, such as Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, often show GDP per capita below the
          EU baseline. This visualization allows us to explore whether higher educational attainment is associated with
          higher national economic productivity, suggesting that a more educated workforce could contribute to economic
          growth and development.

          This line chart compares labour market participation rates over time for individuals with different levels of
          education (primary, secondary, and tertiary). The x-axis represents the years, while the y-axis shows the
          employment rate for each education level. By examining the trends, we can observe how labour market
          participation for individuals with tertiary education has generally increased, reflecting the growing demand
          for higher-skilled workers. In contrast, participation rates for individuals with primary or secondary
          education may show slower growth or stagnation, highlighting the disparity in employment opportunities based
          on educational attainment.

          The heatmap visualizes the unemployment rate across European countries, categorized by education level. Darker
          shades indicate higher unemployment rates, while lighter shades represent lower rates. A clear regional
          pattern emerges: countries in Southern Europe, such as Slovakia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, exhibit higher
          unemployment rates across the lower education levels, with particularly high rates among those with only
          primary or secondary education. In contrast, Northern European nations, such as Germany, Hungary, and Poland,
          show significantly lower unemployment, especially among individuals with tertiary education. Interestingly, in
          Slovakia, although there is high unemployment in the level 0-2 educational levels, there is a very low
          unemployment rate in the higher educational levels.
